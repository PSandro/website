Some time ago I decided to build a voron 3d-printer. The voron 3d-printers are designed by a great community with lots of experience and dedication. While their larger models are most popular, I decided to go with the smallest one - the V0 with a build volume of `120mm x 120mm x 120mm` for portability reasons.

When doing prototyping with friends or some hobby project I often wished to have my beloved voron v0.2 close by. Sadly it's too fragile for surving the transport with confidence; The countless hours invested in building and calibrating it might quickly go to waste if it takes damage while taking it outside my home lab. This is why it needed a strong and sturdy case to keep it safe for travels. A flightcase was needed.

# Designing

I started with the design and decided on a material and hardware. It ended up being `6mm` wodden plate and some flightcase aluminium casemaker extrusions. After designing the whole thing in CAD it was ready for production.

# Manufacturing

Luckily I have access to a CNC-Machine with which I could cut out the wooden plates in a few minutes. The casemaker extrusions were cut using a horizontal bandsaw. In heinseight I should have used a cross-cut saw for a better finish.

I probably put too many rivots, but it doesn't hurt the rigidity so...

The foam was cut and glued to the inside of the box.
