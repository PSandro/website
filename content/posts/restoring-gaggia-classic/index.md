I bought an old Gaggia Classic espresso machine for cheap. The previous owner claimed that the pressure was off sometimes and that there was some rust on the frame.
What caught my attention when looking at the pictures from the offering was the fact that the labels on the switches were in pretty good shape. Either the switches got replaced at some point or the machine hasn't seen much use.

The price was 82â‚¬ shipping included.


## Opening the Gaggia for the first time

When people service their Gaggia Classic machines at home, one common practice is to label the connectors with numbers. Nobody has done it for this machine which either means it hasn't been serviced at all or the maintenance was done professionally without requiring labels. Knowing what I know now, I think the first was the case.
